# in train.py, why we write the 'gpus' 'numworkers'
# try to change the optimizer such as ADAM
# in train.py max_epochs means ?(eps, dot_interval, best_acc)
# why in the utils the function read_net_cfg batch_normalize = 0
# why wo should use anchor_step in the neuralnet
# in the neural net the function __init__() some parameter cause me confused
# in the loss LOSS some parameter cause me confused
#a full neural net contain train and vaild
#train contains read datacfg, read netcfg, read weightcfg.
# we should detect the corners of our table,why not use neural network to estimate them
# darknet loader mesh loss load_weights save_weights
#train vaild depth 
# I want to write code which can running happily and I can understand every sentences
# nW,nH 
#Loss build_targets for t in range(50):
# I skip the loss and copy them without thinking for I don't know the structure of the data and the input and output of pytorch layers, and the algorithm which is responsible to compute the loss
# insomewhere, the variable has been assigned in the code, what is the meaning of setting in the netcfg.data (print_configure_of_net(blocks):)
